The chief product is a Internet browser-based extension that gives users the power to be specific when they share Internet content with friends.</p>
<p><img src="/img/helptile.gif" alt="Demonstration of publishing a Tile with HelpTile"></p>
<p>The extension is used to point-to, or &quot;tag&quot;, the parts of a webpage that matter most. Users share a URL with others that goes back to the tagged webpage...but once we land on the webpage, the user is immediately taken to the specific image, paragraph, sentence, or word. It&#39;s granular!</p>
<p>During my six months with the HelpTile team, I wore a lot of hats. As the first full-time employee, after the three founders, I had major input on the Product Design and Front-end Development.</p>
<p>As a Designer, I translated the goals generated by our weekly sprints into pencil-and-paper designs. These designs were reviewed, modified, and eventually taken to digital wireframes. I had the pleasure of working with <a href="http://madewithmath.com">Tommy O&#39;Connor</a>, the Lead Designer and mentor to me.</p>
<p>With detailed wireframe/mockups in hand, I returned to the Developer&#39;s Cave. <a href="http://www.darrylivanbrown.com">Darryl Brown</a> guided the other devs and myself into the wonderful world of modern Javascript, NPM, asynchronisity, and general hacking goodness.</p>
<p><a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> saved the day for our state-driven extension. Styles were written in <a href="http://sass-lang.com">SASS</a> and we utilized Grunt to take care of all the automation and task-running. I got my feet wet writing functional tests (using <a href="https://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a> / <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a>) which simulated user interactions in multiple browser environments to ensure consistent experiences. Behind the scenes, our application communicated with a REST-ful API maintained in PHP.</p>
