		When life gives you oppportunities, make the most of them! [HelpTile](http://helptile.com) (originally BitTag) is a Flagstaff, Arizona start-up company. The chief product is a Google Chrome-based browser extension that gives users the power to be specific when they share Internet content with friends.

		The extension is used to point-to, or "tag", the parts of a webpage that matter most. Users share a URL with others which not only goes back to the tagged webpage -- once we land on the webpage, the user is immediately taken to the specific image or paragraph (or sentence, or word...it's quite granular). 

		During my six months with the HelpTile crew, I wore a lot of hats. As the first full-time employee, after the three founders, I had major input on the Product Design and Front-end Development. 

		As a Designer, I translated the goals generated by our weekly sprints into pencil-and-paper designs. These designs were reviewed, modified, and eventually taken to digital wireframes. I had the extreme pleasure of working with [Tommy O'Connor](http://madewithmath.com), a proficient UI/UX and Graphic Designer, who acted as Lead Designer and mentor to me. 

		With detailed wireframe/mockups in hand, I always ended up in the Developer's Cave. CTO, Darryl Brown, Co-Founder Edward Kemper, and myself kept busy using Node.js (React, Mocha, Grunt) to develop a robust front-end that communicated with a REST-ful PHP API.
