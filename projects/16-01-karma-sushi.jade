		Sashimi, seaweed salad, and sake...an incredible treat in the high desert. I collaborated with the wonderful [Darcy Falk](http://darcyfalk.com/), [Jen Saunders](http://www.jensaunders.com), and [Darryl Brown](http://www.2bdesign.us) to bring the responsive website to production.

		Built with Yii, a Rails-like PHP MVC application framework, this project began as a customer-facing platform for practical, business related information. After it's release in early 2015, I continued to maintain the website and introduce new features such as an employee portal for job orientation, training, and communication.
