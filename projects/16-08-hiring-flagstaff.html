        <h1><a title="Hiring Flagstaff" target="_blank">Hiring Flagstaff</a></h1><p>Hiring Flagstaff is a unified platform to promote jobs, internships, and other services to jobseekers, free for any business in Northern Arizona,. It is also designed to introduce Trailing Partners -- people who are unemployed and unable to find work with an employed spouse -- to local businesses, large and small.</p>
<p>My role as the sole developer is to bring the entire project from design to launch and includes: Database modeling and construction (MySQL), configuring a LAMP server with automation scripting, evaluating and addressing security concerns, and setting up routine transactional email services. On the front end, I have worked closely with the <a href="http://madewithmath.com/">Made With Math</a> team&#39;s designer and project manager to actualize the mockups into usable code.</p>
<p>The project is facilitated through the <a href="http://www.flagstaffchamber.com/">Greater Flagstaff Chamber of Commerce</a> and funded in-part through generous industry sponsors. It is scheduled for a Fall 2016 launch, currently undergoing quality control, testing, and marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Please check in soon for a post-launch update!</p>
