        <h1><a href="http://helptile.com" title="HelpTile" target="_blank">HelpTile</a></h1><p>When life gives you oppportunities, make the most of them! <a href="http://helptile.com">HelpTile</a> is a Flagstaff, Arizona start-up company. The chief product is a Google Chrome-based browser extension that gives users the power to be specific when they share Internet content with friends.</p>
<p><img src="/img/helptile.gif" alt="Demonstration of publishing a Tile with HelpTile"></p>
<p>The extension is used to point-to, or &quot;tag&quot;, the parts of a webpage that matter most. Users share a URL with others which not only goes back to the tagged webpage -- once we land on the webpage, the user is immediately taken to the specific image or paragraph (or sentence, or word...it&#39;s quite granular).</p>
<p>During my six months with the HelpTile crew, I wore a lot of hats. As the first full-time employee, after the three founders, I had major input on the Product Design and Front-end Development.</p>
<p>As a Designer, I translated the goals generated by our weekly sprints into pencil-and-paper designs. These designs were reviewed, modified, and eventually taken to digital wireframes. I had the pleasure of working with <a href="http://madewithmath.com">Tommy O&#39;Connor</a> who acted as Lead Designer and mentor to me.</p>
<p>With detailed wireframe/mockups in hand, I returned to the Developer&#39;s Cave. <a href="http://www.darrylivanbrown.com">Darryl Brown</a> guided the other devs and myself into the wonderful world of modern Javascript of NPM libraries, asynchronisity, and general hacking goodness.</p>
<p>Every project can allow for one new technology, and I was excited about the prospect of <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>. This library saved the day for our state-heavy extension. Styles were written in <a href="http://sass-lang.com">SASS</a> and we implemented Grunt to take care of all the file watching and task-running. I even got around to writing functional tests (using <a href="https://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a> / <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a>) which simulated user interactions in multiple browser environments. Behind the scenes, our application communicated with a REST-ful API maintained in PHP.</p>
