    When life gives you oppportunities, make the most of them! [HelpTile](http://helptile.com) is a Flagstaff, Arizona start-up company. The chief product is a Internet browser-based extension that gives users the power to be specific when they share Internet content with friends.

    The extension is used to point-to, or "tag", the parts of a webpage that matter most. Users share a URL with others that goes back to the tagged webpage...but once we land on the webpage, the user is immediately taken to the specific image, paragraph, sentence, or word. It's granular!

    During my six months with the HelpTile team, I wore a lot of hats. As the first full-time employee, after the three founders, I had major input on the Product Design and Front-end Development.

    As a Designer, I translated the goals generated by our weekly sprints into pencil-and-paper designs. These designs were reviewed, modified, and eventually taken to digital wireframes. I had the pleasure of working with [Tommy O'Connor](http://madewithmath.com), the Lead Designer and mentor to me.

    With detailed wireframe/mockups in hand, I returned to the Developer's Cave. [Darryl Brown](http://www.darrylivanbrown.com) guided the other devs and myself into the wonderful world of modern Javascript, NPM, asynchronisity, and general hacking goodness.

    [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) saved the day for our state-driven extension. Styles were written in [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) and we utilized Grunt to take care of all the automation and task-running. I got my feet wet writing functional tests (using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) / [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/)) which simulated user interactions in multiple browser environments to ensure consistent experiences. Behind the scenes, our application communicated with a REST-ful API maintained in PHP.
